## Functional Programming 

A function called a map, the function is taking array and callback as arguments. In this function i created empty array called updated. So im gonna be pushing updated array indexes into updated empty array. Then i created a for loop over the original array, so for every  single item in the array, im gonna be calling the callback and passing the current index. Whatever thats gonna return from the index, im gonna store  as index in the updated array

I created new variable called updated, which is invocation of callback and passes the indexes of array.

The console output print the result of the map function

## Object Oriented Programming 

Created a class called Person. Then i created a constructor  because when you instintiate your object , the constructor will be first thing to run. Inside my constructor, i placed two different variables that are gonna come when i instintiate a new person and basically set them so they are accessable thoughout my class.

I used this keyword becausenit is related to my class. So i used this.variable so that they can be accessable. I created a method that returns those fields. I created get.Name that returns this.name and also get.Surname that returns this.surname.

I created  a new variable Person1 equals to new Person() using the  keyword 'new', because i want to insintiate a new version of the person class. I passed two variables (name and surname) from the constructor and i passed them to the new person parentheses.

The console print the output of the new person.
